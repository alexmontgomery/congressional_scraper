# Overview
* `congressional_scraper.py`: navigates to congressional record page w/ textual transcript, then extracts this using BeautifulSoup
* Saves extracted text to .txt file (might need to tweak file naming)
* Bills appear to be formatted differently HTML-wise compared to events/amendments/etc. This has been handled, but not sure if there are other formats that need to be accounted for
